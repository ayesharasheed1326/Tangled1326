						Long ago, a drop of magical sunlight falls from the sky and sprouts a flower with healing
						powers. Upon discovering it, an old beggar woman named Mother Gothel hides the flower and uses
						it to stay young for centuries, until royal soldiers from the nearby kingdom of Corona find and
						uproot it to save their pregnant and ill Queen. The Queen gives birth to a baby princess with
						long golden hair. While the king and queen are sleeping one evening, Gothel discovers the hair
						has the same powers as the flower, but turns brown and becomes powerless when cut. She kidnaps
						the girl, named Rapunzel, and raises her in a hidden tower in the woods, using her hair to stay
						young.

						Each year, on Rapunzel's birthday, the king and queen release thousands of sky lanterns in hope
						she will see them and return home. Rapunzel becomes obsessed with the distant lights, and, on
						the eve of her 18th birthday, asks Gothel for permission to see them closer. Gothel refuses,
						claiming that the outside world is dangerous and Rapunzel is too weak and young to survive in
						it. Later, handsome thief Flynn Rider steals Rapunzel's intended crown from the palace, abandons
						his partners, the Stabbington brothers, and takes refuge in the tower. Rapunzel knocks him out
						and hides him in a closet. She tries to show him to Gothel as proof she is capable of taking
						care of herself; however, Gothel refuses to listen, so Rapunzel sends Gothel on a three-day
						journey to get new paints as a birthday gift.<br><br>

						Rapunzel hides the crown and tells Flynn he can only get it back by taking her to see the
						lights. Along the way, they stop at the Snuggly Duckling pub, where menacing thugs try to
						capture the wanted Flynn. Rapunzel soon charms them into revealing their softer sides; when
						royal guards arrive, the thugs help her and Flynn to escape. Meanwhile, Gothel becomes
						suspicious, returns to the empty tower, and finds the crown. She sets out to find Rapunzel, and
						allies herself with the Stabbington brothers.

						In escaping from the guards, Flynn and Rapunzel become trapped in a fast-flooding cave. Thinking
						they will die, Flynn resignedly reveals his true name (Eugene Fitzherbert) and Rapunzel reveals
						her magic powers. Her glowing hair shows a previously hidden exit, and they escape and take
						refuge in the woods. That night, Gothel catches up to Rapunzel while Eugene is away, gives her
						the crown, and tells her to use it to test Eugene's loyalty.

						The next morning, a palace horse named Maximus tracks down Eugene and attempts to arrest him.
						Rapunzel demands a truce in honor of her birthday, and Maximus reluctantly agrees, joining them
						as they enter the kingdom and attend a festival in honor of the "lost princess".

			They spend the day celebrating with the townsfolk, then sail onto the lake to watch the release of the lanterns. Having fulfilled her dream, Rapunzel gives Eugene back the crown. The two confess their love, when Eugene sees the Stabbington brothers. He walks off to apologize, and offers them the crown, but they tie him to a ship so the royal guards will arrest him and Rapunzel will think he abandoned her. They then try to capture Rapunzel, but Gothel stages a "rescue" and takes Rapunzel home.

			Eugene escapes with the help of Maximus and the pub thugs. Meanwhile, Rapunzel realizes she has subconsciously incorporated the kingdom's standard into her artwork all her life; finally understanding that she is the "lost princess", she confronts Gothel. Eugene arrives at the tower, and her hair is thrown down to him. Upon climbing up, however, he finds she has been bound and gagged, and Gothel fatally stabs him from behind. She tries to drag Rapunzel to a new hiding place.

					Rapunzel offers to go willingly, if Gothel will allow her to heal Eugene. Realising she would be spending the rest of her life in Gothel's captivity, Eugene cuts off Rapunzel's hair before she can heal him. Gothel begins to age rapidly and turns to dust as she falls out of the tower.

Rapunzel mourns the loss of Eugene, and one of her tears, still having some of the sun's power, saves his life.
